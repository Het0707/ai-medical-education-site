        <h2>Current Use of AI in Canadian Hospitals</h2>

        <p>
            Canadian hospitals are actively integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies into daily clinical
            workflows.
            These applications are aimed at improving diagnostic accuracy, optimizing workflow efficiency, and
            supporting
            decision-making.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Radiology and Imaging</h3>
        <p>
            AI-powered tools like computer vision are now used to analyze X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs to detect anomalies
            such
            as tumors, fractures, and infections. For instance, hospitals in Ontario have piloted AI systems that assist
            radiologists in detecting early-stage lung cancer.

        <h3>2. Predictive Analytics for Diagnostics</h3>
        <p>
            Machine learning models are used to predict patient outcomes based on historical data, lab results, and
            patient vitals.
            These tools are being used in emergency departments to triage patients and identify those at high risk of
            deterioration or readmission.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Virtual Assistants & Chatbots</h3>
        <p>
            Some hospitals have introduced AI chatbots to assist in pre-diagnosis and appointment booking. These tools
            can
            collect preliminary data and route patients to the appropriate departments.
