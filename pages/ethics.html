    <h2>Ethical Implications of AI in Healthcare</h2>

    <p>
      While AI offers numerous benefits, its implementation in medical diagnostics also raises several ethical
      challenges. It is essential to balance innovation with ethical considerations for responsible adoption.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Data Privacy & Security</h3>
    <p>
      Medical AI systems rely on vast amounts of patient data. Ensuring the security and privacy of this sensitive
      information is a major concern. Breaches could lead to identity theft or misuse of personal health information.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Algorithmic Bias</h3>
    <p>
      If training data is biased or unrepresentative, AI models may yield unfair or incorrect results, potentially
      discriminating against certain demographics. Ethical AI must ensure fairness, inclusivity, and accuracy.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Job Displacement</h3>
    <p>
      The increasing automation of diagnostic tasks could lead to the displacement of radiologists, lab technicians, and
      administrative staff. While AI augments human ability, healthcare systems must plan for reskilling and role
      evolution.
