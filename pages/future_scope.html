        <h2>The Future of AI in Medical Diagnostics</h2>
        <p>
          The future of Artificial Intelligence in healthcare is full of promise. In the coming years, AI is expected
          to play a vital role in personalized and preventative medicine, driven by genomic data and real-time patient
          monitoring.

        <h3>1. Genomics and Precision Medicine</h3>
        <p>
          AI can analyze vast genomic datasets to identify disease-causing genes and suggest targeted therapies. This
          enables
          the development of personalized treatment plans for conditions such as cancer, diabetes, and rare genetic
          disorders.

        <h3>2. Virtual Diagnostics and Digital Twins</h3>
        <p>
          Future diagnostic systems may use AI to create digital representations or “twins” of patients that simulate
          health conditions in real time. These virtual models can be used to predict disease progression or test
          treatment plans
          before applying them in real life.

        <h3>3. Integration with Wearable Devices</h3>
        <p>
          AI will continue to integrate with smartwatches, biosensors, and mobile health apps to track health conditions
          24/7 and trigger alerts for abnormal readings, allowing for early intervention and remote diagnostics.
